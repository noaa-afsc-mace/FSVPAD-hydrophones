# FSVPAD

FSVPAD is a free-drifting hydrophone spar buoy designed for measurement of vessel-radiated noise designed for NOAA Fisheries noise-reduced research vessels.

This repository provides processing software, technical information, and example data output from an instrument deployment as described in a NOAA Technical memorandum:

Bassett, C., De Robertis, A., Gallagher, M.  In preparation.  A low-cost passive acoustic drifter for radiated noise measurements of NOAA fisheries survey vessels.

## Primary directories
**Matlab** - contains processing scripts to estimate vessel radiated noise from FSVPAD measurements

**Technical documentation** - contains technical documentation related to construction and configuration of the FSVPAD system

**Example results** - contains example output of the processing scripts from a 2023 measurement of NOAA ship Oscar Dyson.

# Prerequisites
The analysis scripts require Matlab and the signal processing and statistics toolboxes.
